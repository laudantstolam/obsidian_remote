Good morning everyone, I'm Sally and I’d like to discuss the topic about the "Chrome" browser. I think almost everyone in our class uses Chrome every day, ==but personally, I believe that== this browser is one of the most potentially invasive applications inside our devices. Since nowadays, we have numerous accounts and credentials needed to be managed, we often rely on browser features like cookie settings to assist keeping our account credits. However, while granting permissions for such conveniences, we may inadvertently allow the browser to collect and utilize our data for purposes beyond our awareness. ==Another point was== it also collects user's background data and implement them into other commercial usage. ==As a proof of this== is that there are several times that I went to online shopping using my phone and the next day when I open my PC, the ads show the exact item I bought. Ever since then I think my personal data was leaked out so I started to avoid using chrome browser.

Since nowadays, we have numerous accounts and credentials needed to be managed, we often rely on browser features like cookie settings to assist keeping our account credits. However, while granting permissions for such conveniences, we may inadvertently allow the browser to collect and utilize our data for purposes beyond our awareness.

Furthermore, one concerning aspect is the way Chrome collects user's background data and potentially implements it for other commercial uses. An example that highlights this issue occurred when I engaged in online shopping using my phone. Strangely, the very next day when I opened my PC, I noticed targeted advertisements displaying the exact items I had purchased. This experience raised significant concerns about the extent to which my personal data was being utilized without my explicit consent. Consequently, I began to question the level of privacy and security offered by Chrome and subsequently started exploring alternative browser options.
