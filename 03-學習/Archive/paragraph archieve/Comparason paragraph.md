## Paragraph

Whether sending children to a public school or a private school during elementary school and middle school's period could be a suffering decision for many parents in Taiwan. Public schools have a chill learning environment, while private schools have a tougher but higher-quality environment. In a nutshell, each has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on what dimension we focus on.

To begin, we must examine the benefits and drawbacks of the two types of schools so that we may make an informed decision about which to attend. Starting with private schools, many of us have a stereotype of them as schools where wealthy people send their children, and there are. However, in comparison to the expensive tuition fees, they provide a better learning environment, and students are more likely to be academically focused. Furthermore, teachers at a private school have a greater responsibility to care for each student and ensure their learning conditions. This method ensures that private students' average scores are higher, but the extensive coursework and stringent direction also put pressure on them.

In comparison, the situation at a public school is the inverse. Since the majority of Taiwanese students attended public schools, the most notable characteristic was their diversity. Public schools in different cities might have different special school events. For example, it appears that aboriginal-related events are held at public schools in Hualian and Taidong. And students in public schools come from a diverse range of backgrounds. Children can make friends with a variety of people and broaden their horizons while learning with joy. But at the same time, teachers have little accountability for students since public schools provide a less rigorous method of education. As a result, pupils in public schools are frequently required to attend a cram school in order to maintain their academic standing.

~~To summarize, private and public schools provide various learning environments and have different approaches and fees.  Both have pros and cons, but while deciding which to go with, we must consider which is the best option for the child and the family. There are no absolute answers for any of the options, simply the most appropriate, because education can only supply you with sources, but the achievement still need our own efforts.~~

To summarize, both public and private educational system has their own pros and cons, but while deciding which to go with, we must consider which is the best option for the child and the family. And as a suffering student from private school system, I think it's more important to let children learn in a happier enviorment and meet various people to enlarge the vision of childrens and since we may studied campus for once a lifetime, make it a precious memories instead of suffering in a place filled with endless tests and ranking was more important.
