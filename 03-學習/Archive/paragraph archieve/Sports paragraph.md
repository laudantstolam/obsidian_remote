### Paragraph

Most of us associate archery with the Olympic sport, in which athletes aim their targets with recurve bows. However, Kyudou (弓道) is another name for traditional archery in Japan. The archer wears on Kyudo uniform, simillar to Japan's traditional 'kimono' attire, and use bow made of bamboo to aim a target 28 meters away. The essence of Kyudou of is to maintain a good body posture and concentration in order to shoot towards the target.

There are 8 basic process in Kyudou from stepping, settle the string in hands, lifting the bow until the release the string. These steps defined the accurate body movement and how to adjust muscles in order to "lead" the bow to shoot towards the target. Different from using hand's power to shoot on a recurve bows, Kyudou are more focused in seperate the power into different part of body. For instance, we open our legs to stable our center of gravity and use shoulder blade to pull back our arms. This can effectively reduce the force acting on the arm and distribute it throughout the body.

Moving beyond the basics, Kyudou was not just about hit on a target, it also imply a theme of "Good shot will hit", with a accurate posture and mindset that you will definately hit the target. That's also the reason Kyudou's bow don't have any equipment nor aiming machiene on it. Besides, in the process of training, we can also avoid modern habits such as hunchback and sore shoulders.

Last but not least, the reason I startes Kyudou was the fascinating sound when the arrow leaves the string and pass through the air, it suddently take over my mind. Since then I started Kyudou in the school's club and found out the joy of practicing with friens and also train my body into a better posture.
