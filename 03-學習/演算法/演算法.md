	Effectiveness-executabe
	Finiteness-terminate after some certain steps(we can expect/predict a result)

- procedure / algorithm
	**STOP or not**

- Describing Algorithm
	Graph
	Programming Language
	Pseudo code T_T

- SOME FYI in pseudo code(è¦‹CH2)
	Loooooop-whiile/for/repeat/.... (in PASCAL)
	"call by value"
	NIL-no object
	Indentation as block structure
	local variables
