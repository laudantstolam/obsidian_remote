A stack of white paper on the corner of a table that is meaningless 
Left behind, untouched by a melody 
The idea that I wrote, and no one cares about it 
Leaving a mark that I cannot erase

"Just stop, no one is listening to you" 
Hindered by the world, I try to give up
But the dream that night can still be seen 
Pulling my hands towards it

 "Reach out to it"

I will sing for you 
I will let you hear 
This heart's melody that has been long kept 
Fly, tell the dream behind the clouds

Accompanied by the moon, protected by the sea of stars 
The second chance that is almost missed 
I will rewrite everything that is lost into a melody 
Without any intention of erasing it again
