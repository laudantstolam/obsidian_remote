A stack of white paper on the corner of a table that is meaningless 
Left behind, untouched by a melody 
The idea that I wrote, and no one cares about it 
Leaving a mark that I cannot erase

"Just stop, no one is listening to you" 
Hindered by the world, I try to give up
But the dream that night can still be seen 
Pulling my hands towards it

 "Reach out to it"

I will sing for you 
I will let you hear 
This heart's melody that has been long kept 
Fly, tell the dream behind the clouds
