I was reminded of the time in my past
when I was lost, not knowing
where
is the shoulder I should lean on.
 
I shut my mouth and hid my voice
while stupidly I believed
there can never be
someone who is willing to listen.
 
I'm searching for the place that I could call my own
without knowing how far it will be
until my fate comes calling for me.
 
Where will it be? I wonder where my footsteps will end up taking me.
Where will it be? I wonder where this fragile heart will return.
I'm trapped in the darkness, no answers in sight
but you came to me just like the moon within the starry skies.
 
I'm sure that yours has to be the smile
that will be by my side when I sing out
"I'm home"
 
Just like a song echoing in the silence
you came and brought all the laughter
that comforted me
within its peace.
 
I could never forget those times
when the two of us were in joy.
No matter when it is,
it will feel like the first time we met.
 
I'm still searching for the place that I could call my own
without knowing where I should look for it
but I'm sure you will be there.
 
Where will it be? I wonder where my footsteps will end up taking me.
Where will it be? I wonder where this fragile heart will return with me.
Where will it be? I wonder where I can sing a piece of melody.
Where will it be? I wonder where this harmony will return with me.
I'm trapped in the darkness, no answers in sight
but you came to me just like the moon within the starry skies.
 
I'm sure that yours has to be the smile
that will be by my side when I sing out
"I'm home"
