5-10 sentences

I've lately been reading poems and English literature. The turning point in reading these GRAMATICAL and nerdy stuff is that I've previously been reading some Chinese literature, and one of them mentions some translated sentences from those English books and they inpressed me a lot. It also piques my interest in starting to read them. For more spesific I'm currently reading "The Wast Land" by T.S. Eilot, which is commonly regarded as an astringent passage. However, the deeper meanings within the phrases are intriguing, and the word usage is also lovely.

After the long break, I could feel the whole body and soles are healed. Also, lately there's been some interesting news going on in the music industry. First, it's Ed Sheeran's new album "Autumn Variations" it's Ed's style as always but this album is more cozy and country style. I like the 5th and the 6th songs the most, for its rhythm and lyrics. The other news is the famous rap audition show "Rhythm + Flow" France series announced the 3rd season is dropping on. It's just past a couple month since S2 finished.
