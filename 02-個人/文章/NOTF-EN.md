[verse]
They're the perfect ones to ever roam this world. 
That's what you said each time you tread up the high road. 
They're the chosen ones to control every word, 
Yet all they've made are all those fake souls that you hold.

[Pre-chorus] 
Go on and believe the lies that they have taught. 
Rambling's what humanity is all about. 
You're sitting down so quietly for your fate 
Fumbling and tumbling, realizing it's too late 

[Chorus] 
Listen close and see how hard they try to pull you down 
With useless identity to a tarnished rusty crown. 
All that rotting dying flesh and blood 
You're more than just an oversaturated clown 
Crush all you've been told, Look inside, 
and let the Nocturne wear you down 

[Verse 2] 
Inside those questions that served as distraction 
They killed your soul, reduce it down to a fraction, no passion. 
They pushed you to a scheme. 
You called it dream. It's all a meme. 
You're crying. It meant nothing! 
This dark regime is nothing divine. It puts you in line 
With identities assigned intertwined in a hive mind. So who are you? 'Cause the moment they define you 
Is when you're judge through a value devoid of virtue. 

[Pre-chorus] 
Go on and believe the lies that they have taught 
Rambling's what humanity is all about. 
You're sitting down so quietly for your fate 
Fumbling and tumbling, realizing it's too late. 

[Chorus] 
Listen close and see how nothing is truly profound. 
Oh this false humanity is just shameless all-around. 
All that rotting, dying flesh and blood, 
You're more than just an oversaturated clown. 
Crush all you've been told, Let the darkness break it down. 
Listen close and see how hard they try to pull you down. 
With useless identity to a tarnished rusty crown. 
All that rotting, dying flesh and blood 
You're more than just an oversaturated clown. 
Crush all you've been told, Look inside, 
and let the Nocturne wear you down.
