Whether government should support artistic field instead of athletic fields remains a certain spaces for discussion. It was not just about two different dimensions of activity also a conflict between culture and regions. In my point of view, I consider governments should spend more money supporting art due to the variety of people's entertainment, long-lasting culture's continuation and also the precious values of arts.  
  
Firstly, art can be in various form. Dance, artwork, music were all different status of arts. As governments showing their support, people;s willingness of get in tough with more kinds of arts increases. In concept, athletics seemed more distances with most of the people and civils.  
  
The nest important point was the ethereal value of arts. Arts are the continue form of human's culture, knowledge and life style. When we pay more effort on protecting and remaining, our child may have a chance to see the variety of human's culture and passing our spirit to the next generation which worth our hard work to maintain them.  
  
Final reason of why government should spend more money on art was it's precious value that worth our supportance. Though art can be both visible and invisible, physical arts like sculpture and drawings should be keeping in the enviorments best fits their material or else they will be erosion through time. Invisible art like dance and culture also disappear as people gradually forgetting them and no people to passing on these culture and living style that our parents passed on us.  
  
In conclusion, due to the above reasons of how and why art is more worthable to be supported and maintained the governments should spend more money in support artistic fields instead of athletics fields.

引言： 
The **allocation** of government funds towards the arts or athletics is an ==ongoing topic of debate.== In my opinion, governments should prioritize funding for the arts. This essay will provide specific reasons and examples to support this stance.

主體段落 1： 
Art encompasses a wide range of forms, such as dance, visual arts, and music. By allocating more resources to the arts, governments can **foster** a diverse cultural environment and encourage public engagement. For instance, funding for art exhibitions, music festivals, and theater performances can ==expose people to ==various artistic expressions, allowing them to appreciate different forms of creativity.

主體段落 2： 
==One crucial aspect== of supporting the arts is their role in preserving and continuing human culture. Art represents the collective knowledge, traditions, and values of a society. By investing in the arts, governments ensure the **preservation** of cultural heritage for future generations. For example, financial support for the maintenance of historical sites, traditional crafts, and **indigenous** artwork safeguards the rich cultural tapestry of a nation.

主體段落 3： 
Art possesses a unique and irreplaceable value that **warrants** government support. While physical art forms like sculptures and paintings require proper conservation to withstand the test of time, **intangible** forms such as dance and cultural practices also necessitate ongoing support to prevent their disappearance. Governments can allocate resources to document and promote traditional dances, rituals, and other intangible cultural assets, preserving them for the benefit of society.

In conclusion, governments should allocate more funds to support the arts due to their diverse and enriching nature, their role in cultural preservation, and their intrinsic value. ==By prioritizing the arts,== governments contribute to the promotion of creativity, the preservation of cultural heritage, and the overall well-being of society.
