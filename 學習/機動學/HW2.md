1. Please explain the "inventive step" of the new rear mounting bracket shown below.

2. For the screen supporting rack shown above, please indicate its four links and show that it has 3 DOF.

3. For the door closer shown above, please indicate its four links and determine its DOF by observation.

4. In problems 2 and 3 both mechanisms are composed of four kinematic links. What's the main reason which results in different number of DOF?
