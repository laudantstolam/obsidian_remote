Homework of 12/21 (due 12/28 10 AM)

1. In the following 4-bar linkage where 
	O2B=152 mm, 
	BC=273 mm, 
	O4C=224 mm, 
	O2O4=376 mm, 
	BD=175 mm, 
	alpha=15.5° and 
	theta2=60°, 
	Omega2=30 rad/sec CW. 
	
	Please redraw the linkage precisely and find the magnitudes and directions of Omega3, Omega4, and velocity of point D by using “VECTOR POLYGON TECHNIQUE.”

3. Redo problem 1 by using “INSTANT CENTER METHOD.”
