### Frequency response method

the frequency response of a system is defined as the steady-state reponse of system to a sinusoical input signal. The resulting output signal fot a linear system is sinusodal in the steady-state is differs from the input waveform only in amplitude and phase angle.

for example
$$Y(s)=T(s)R(s),r(t)=Asinwt$$
$$thus, R(s)=\frac{Aw}{S^2+w^2}$$
$$T(s)=\frac{m(s)}{q(s)}=\frac{m(s)}{s}$$
