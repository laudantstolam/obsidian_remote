### Measurement of relative stability

>[!note] (1) Gain margin:
$20log(\frac{1}{L(jw_g)})$ at the frequency $w_g$ that $\angle L(jw_g)=-180$
thus the system gain would have to be increased the $L(jw_g)$ locus to pass through the (-1,0) point

> 距離不穩定的量化距離
> 做法:得到gain再取20log
> gain margin<1

>[!note] (2) Phase margin
>	$\angle L(jw_p)-(-180^\circ)=\angle L(jw_p)+180^\circ$ at ferquency $w_{p}$ that $|L(jw_p)|=1$
>	$\Rightarrow$ the $L(jw)$ locus must be rotated to pass through the (-1,0) point
