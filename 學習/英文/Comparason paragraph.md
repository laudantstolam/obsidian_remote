## Paragraph

Whether sending children to a public school or a private school during elementary school and middle school's period could be a suffering desition for many parents in Taiwan. Public school has a chill learning enviorment while private school has a toughter but higher quality condition. In a nutshell, each has its own advantages and disadvantages base on what dimension we focus on.

To begin, we must examine the benefits and drawbacks of the two types of schools so that we may make an informed decision about which to attend. Starting with private schools, many of us have a stereotype of them as schools where wealthy people send their children, and there are. However, in comparison to the expensive tuition fees, they provide a better learning environment and students are more likely to be academically focused. Furthermore, teachers at a private school have a greater responsibility to care for each student and ensure their learning condition. This method ensures that private students' average scores are higher, but the extensive coursework and stringent direction also put pressure on them.

In comparison, public school has an opposite situation. Public school which most of the students in Taiwan went to. The biggest feature was its variety, public school in different city cpuld have differ special school event. For example, public school in Hualian or Taidong appears to hold aboriginal related events at school. And students in public school tend to have a variety of background. Which children may also make friends with different kinds of people and explore a wider vision while learning with joy. Since public school provided less tough way of educating, teachers don't have much responsibility for students. That cause students in public school often have to go to a cram school to ensure their academic score.
