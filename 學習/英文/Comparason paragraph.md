## Paragraph

Whether sending children to a public school or a private school during elementary school and middle school's period could be a suffering desition for many parents in Taiwan. Public school has a chill learning enviorment while private school has a toughter but higher quality condition. In a nutshell, each has its own advantages and disadvantages base on what dimension we focus on.

To begin, we must examine the benefits and drawbacks of the two types of schools so that we may make an informed decision about which to attend. Starting with private schools, many of us have a stereotype of them as schools where wealthy people send their children, and there are. However, in comparison to the expensive tuition fees, they provide a better learning environment and students are more likely to be academically focused. Furthermore, teachers at a private school have a greater responsibility to care for each student and ensure their learning condition. This method ensures that private students' average scores are higher, but the extensive coursework and stringent direction also put pressure on them.

In comparison, the situation at public school is the inverse. Since the majority of Taiwanese students attended public school, the most notable characteristic was its diversity. Public schools in different cities might have different special school events. For example, it appears that aboriginal-related events are held at public schools in Hualian and Taidong. And pupils in public schools come from a diverse range of backgrounds. Which children can make friends with a variety of people and broaden their horizons while learning with joy. But at the same time, teachers have little accountability for students since public schools provide a less rigorous method of education. As a result, pupils in public schools are frequently required to attend a cram school in order to maintain their academic standing.
